# 🐸 ToadallyBalanced: A Rehabilitation Serious Game

This Unity-based application is a **serious game** designed to support **rehabilitation exercises** using a **balance board**. It provides an interactive and motivating environment for patients recovering from lower limb injuries or working on balance and coordination.

The game tracks real-time movement through a companion Android application that streams gravity sensor data over Wi-Fi, turning your smartphone into a motion controller placed on the balance board.
